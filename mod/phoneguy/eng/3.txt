Cycle 4? Already?
You have proven your abilities without a doubt so far, guardian.
This cycle's call will have to be short, however.
Something has been scratching around in my insides, and it isn't one of the animatronics in that pizzeria.
I hardly listen to my overseers, and as such, I have not figured out what it is yet.
Good luck.
