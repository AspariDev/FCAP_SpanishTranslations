Cycle 4? Already?
You have proven your abilities without a doubt so far, guardian.
This cycle's call will have to be short, however.
Something has been scratching around in my insides, and it isn't one of the animatronics in that pizzeria nor... my sickness, shall we say.
I hardly listen to my overseers' incessant fuss over the creatures in my area, so I am not quite sure what it is so far.
Regardless of what it is, it is causing quite an annoyance.
Good luck.
