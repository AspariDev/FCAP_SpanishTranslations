You have made it to the end of your required tenure! Few manage to persist this long.
I commend your great progress. Assuming you manage this last cycle, you will be rewarded for your valiant efforts.
I suspect you will not want to continue, but I will leave the option open nonetheless.
...
Now may be a suitable time to list retirement plan options should you choose to do so.
Due to some prior (and rather quite) unfortunate developments within my structure, I am unable to house you safely within.
Any other alternative has some form of risk attached. My city is the safest place for you to reside, isolated from the crushing rains us iterators produce.
Should you desire not to continue within this plane, though, I implore you to travel to the west, past the farm arrays, then down into the earth where the land fissures, as deep as you can reach, where the ancients built their temples and danced their silly rituals.
I am an immobile being, unable to travel there myself. You have the option, however.
While I know no place is not hostile in some way towards you, I feel the hostility will be more... manageable, I suppose.
I expect this final cycle will be the most difficult of your required tenure, and thus I shall leave you to fend for yourself. Good luck. You may need it.
