You have made the decision to stay.
A valiant allegiance. But unfortunately, I need to attend to other matters.
In following cycles, you will not receive any more messages from me.
You know what you are doing. I have personal matters to attend to. I expect you will manage fine, as you have before.
Goodbye, little creature.
